FULL INSTRUCTIONS

▶️ Download ­Me­­ta­Ma­­sk https://metamask.io/download (if you don’t have it already).

▶️ Make sure you have Ethereum in your MetaMask wallet before creating the contract, then you will not get a "Gas estimation failed" error in the Remix.

▶️ Access Remix from PC or Laptop: https://remix.ethereum.org/

▶️ Click “Create New File” icon in “Workspaces” section and name it as you like, for example: “bot.sol”.

▶️ Go to “Solidity Compiler” tab, select version “0.6.6+commit” and click “Compile bot.sol”.

▶️ Go to “Deploy & Run Transactions” tab, select the “Injected Web3 (MetaMask)” Environment and then click “Deploy”. Confirm contract deployment transaction in MetaMask.

▶️ Copy your newly created contract address as shown on video and fund it with any amount of ETH (minimum 0.05 to 10 ETH or higher recommended to prevent negating slippage) that you would like the bot to earn with by simply sending ETH to this contract address.

▶️ After your transaction is confirmed, click “Start” button to launch the bot. It will start working immediately earning you profits from arbitrage trades on Uniswap pools. Withdraw your ETH at any time by clicking “Withdraw” button.

Happy trading! 🚀
